                    first babyshower and I had to make it something special.
                    Cake, themed games, corny decorations; everything! All this
                    leading up to the big gender reveal. After making
                    preparations for the event, I thought it would be great to
                    hire a professional photographer so that they could cherish
                    these moments. After some online searching, I came across
                    Momento. It was exactly what I wanted; being able to find
                    the perfect photographer that met all my requirements was
                    amazing!

                    wedding party, then you know how difficult everything is.
                    Being tasked with finding a photographer, I thought I had
                    gotten away with an easy job. Little did I know how wrong I
                    was... I must have gone through at least twenty different
                    photographers until I was just about ready to give up. There
                    seemed to be no end to the little problems that kept popping
                    up. From price to inexperience, it felt like the world was
                    against us. That was when I found Momento. I saved hours of
                    searching browsing through photographers, and narrowing them
                    down to a couple of options based on cost and experience.

                    made it impossible for some of my family members to attend
                    my graduation. Since we didn't want any of them to miss out,
                    we decided to hire a photographer to capture the event.
                    After a week going through contacts and negociating prices,
                    we realized just how difficult it can be to find a
                    professional photographer. Finding Momento was nothing short
                    of a blessing. Within our budget, we were able to find a
                    selection of Pro's to choose from. Those who missed out were
                    able to share the experience even though they could not
                    attend.

                    to hire the photographer. With only a couple days left, I
                    was at my wit's end trying to figure out how I could get a
                    good photographer in such a short time period. After
                    reaching out to all the photographers I knew, it seemed that
                    I would not be able to find anyone available on such short
                    notice. It was then that I decided to give Momento a try. In
                    a few clicks, my party was saved!
