                            <p>Memento is a company that was created in the year 2015 when the current partners found a gap<br>
                                in the photography industry. The gap came about from the fact that clients looking for<br>
                                photographers found a hard time finding their dream photographer. Well,this is where<br>
                                Memento jumped in to help. We came up with a company that connects clients to their dream<br>
                                photographer for any single event available and the price rates for each photographer for<br>
                                each event to save time when looking for photographers and on discussing and bargaining prices.</p>
                            <p>We believe that our company is for every single one of you. Do not worry about the prices<br>
                                because, let's be honest, by the end of the day we want satisafactory work but the money<br>
                                also has it's role to play hence we have the best photographers in the country offering<br>
                                great services at affordable and various prices.</p>
                            <p>We as the memento fraternity try everyday to live by our mission which is we capture<br>
                                your moments from today as we create memories for a lifetime.
